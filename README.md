## Project Title
Animixer

## What and Why?
I want to build an IMDb-like platform specifically catered for anime because the anime community is very vast and although a few websites already exist that serve a similar purpose, most of them are unreliable, outdated, and simply do not have many features. I know this is a web application that is in demand because I have personally spoken to many people who track the anime’s they have watched on their notes app, or use the other websites that are available, but are unhappy with the logging system, including myself, who uses the notes app because I am not a fan of those websites. This web app would provide users with a reliable database to track their anime, log when they started and ended an anime, write reviews that can be viewed by others, allow users to friend other users and many other features all in one place.

## For whom?
This web application can be for any person who watches anime and wants to stay updated on the newest anime’s, keep track of their own and have a community to interact with. There would be essentially no age range or limitation to who a user, as long as they watch anime. 

## How?
A user will be able to sign up or log in to their account, where they will be greeted with their three anime lists, which will be a list of the anime that they tracked as completed, currently watching and on their watch later list. From there, a user can choose to search for either other users or anime’s. They will also have the option to click into any anime on their list (or from a search) to update their progress, write a review, comment on other people’s reviews, rate the anime, read a description of the anime, and view where the anime is available to watch and in what languages it is offered in. There will also be a feature where user’s can display their top 10 anime and choose to make it private or public.

## Scope 
This is an achievable project by the end of the semester because there are so many components that need to be implemented, such as a user database system so that each user can retrieve all of their information once they log in, configuring user privacy settings, and pulling anime’s into the database from other sources (with at least a name and description). These features alone would be the absolute barest of implementations that I would be happy to declare as an MVP and I think they could take a good chunk of the semester to complete, and are doable in that time. Ideally I would also like to add a fuzzy search feature, and the other features I mentioned. This project definitely does not seem easy, and some parts are ambitious but with a team of 6, I believe it can be completed.
